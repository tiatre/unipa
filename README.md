- as few python dependencies as possible

Oh hell yes. Unblessed is chef’s kiss — irreverent, defiant, and dripping with subtext. The name alone already slaps, but let’s give it a backronym that works without ruining the vibe.

Here are a few acronym takes for UNBLESSED, keeping it sharp, satirical, and on-mission:
🅰️ UNBLESSED – Universal, Non-Bureaucratic Linguistic Encoding Standard Supporting Easy Data

    "Unblessed: Because your dataset shouldn’t need a papal blessing."

🅰️ Alt #2: UNBLESSED – Unrestricted, Normalized, Bare Linguistic Encoding: Simple, Sensible, Editable, Denormalized

    Highlights the anti-cldf stance and the tabular/denormalized ethos.

🅰️ Alt #3: UNBLESSED – Ungated, Non-coercive, Bare-bones Linguistic Encoding Standard Sans Evangelical Dogma

    The nuclear option. Satirical and direct. For when you're ready to throw real shade.

🅰️ Alt #4: UNBLESSED – Usable Not-Bloated Language Encoding System for Simple, Everyday Datasets

    A bit tongue-in-cheek, but totally on point if you want a clean README badge.

Branding Line:

    “Unblessed is a defrocked standard. No doctrine, no dependencies, no drama.”

Want me to write the opening README with the acronym embedded, manifesto-style? Or maybe sketch a badge like:
– mock style?

Oh you want NOGOD? Let’s go full scorched earth 🔥

“NOGOD” already feels like a declaration—it’s short, punchy, and heretical in all the best ways. So here come multiple acronym takes, ranging from snarky to semi-serious, all keeping the anti-clerical, anti-gatekeeping spirit alive.
🔥 NOGOD – Best acronym takes
🅰️ NOGOD – No Gatekeepers, Only Data

    Minimalist. Mic drop. Put it on a sticker.

🅰️ NOGOD – Normalized Output for Grammatical & Open Data

    A bit more traditional but still mocking acronym culture.

🅰️ NOGOD – Not Officially Granted Or Divine

    Your dataset does not need holy approval.

🅰️ NOGOD – No Overhead, Greatly Optimized Data

    Lean, mean, blasphemously efficient.

🅰️ NOGOD – No Ontologies, Gatekeepers, Or Dogma

    Direct strike at formalist excess.

🅰️ NOGOD – Non-Orthodox Grammar-Oriented Dataset

    For the rebels in typology.

🅰️ NOGOD – Not Obligated to Genuflect Or Defer

    For datasets that walk upright and unrepentant.

🧨 Satirical README badge:

[![NOGOD-compliant](https://img.shields.io/badge/NOGOD-compliant-black.svg)]()

    "Blessed are the flat files, for they shall inherit the GitHub."

🧠 Bonus use in doc:

    LingFlag and UNBLESSED are proudly NOGOD-compliant.
    This means your dataset is free of institutional burdens, metaphysical dependencies, and citation taxes.

If you want, I can write a full manifesto paragraph with UNBLESSED and NOGOD together, or spin up a badge generator / fake “standards org” like:

ACID – Anti-Canonical Initiative for Datasets
(A fictional standards body run entirely by retired fieldworkers, anarchists, and PhD dropouts.)

Say the word.
